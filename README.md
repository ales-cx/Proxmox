Database
Mariadb LXC

MariaDB
Mariadb LXC
Option to Install Adminer

MariaDB is a community-developed, commercially supported fork of the MySQL relational database management system.

To create a new Proxmox Mariadb LXC, run the following in the Proxmox Shell.

bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://github.com/tteck/Proxmox/raw/main/ct/mariadb-v4.sh)"

‚ö° Default Settings: 1GB RAM - 4GB Storage - 1vCPU ‚ö°

To enable MariaDB to listen to remote connections, you need to edit your defaults file. To do this, open the console in your MariaDB lxc:

nano /etc/mysql/my.cnf

Un-comment port =3306 Save and exit the editor with "Ctrl+O", "Enter" and "Ctrl+X".

nano /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf

Comment bind-address = 127.0.0.1 Save and exit the editor with "Ctrl+O", "Enter" and "Ctrl+X".

For new MariaDB installations, the next step is to run the included security script. This script changes some of the less secure default options. We will use it to block remote root logins and to remove unused database users.

Run the security script:

sudo mysql_secure_installation

Enter current password for root (enter for none): enter

Switch to unix_socket authentication [Y/n] y

Change the root password? [Y/n] n

Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] y

Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] y

Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] y

Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] y

We will create a new account called admin with the same capabilities as the root account, but configured for password authentication.

sudo mysql

Prompt will change to MariaDB [(none)]>

Create a new local admin (Change the username and password to match your preferences)

CREATE USER 'admin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

Give local admin root privileges (Change the username and password to match above)

GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'admin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password' WITH GRANT OPTION;

Now, we'll give the user admin root privileges and password-based access that can connect from anywhere on your local area network (LAN), which has addresses in the subnet 192.168.100.0/24. This is an improvement because opening a MariaDB server up to the Internet and granting access to all hosts is bad practice.. Change the username, password and subnet to match your preferences:

GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'admin'@'192.168.100.%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password' WITH GRANT OPTION;

Flush the privileges to ensure that they are saved and available in the current session:

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Following this, exit the MariaDB shell:

exit

Log in as the new database user you just created:

mysql -u admin -p

Create a new database:

CREATE DATABASE homeassistant;

Following this, exit the MariaDB shell:

exit

‚ö†Ô∏è Reboot the lxc

Checking status.

sudo systemctl status mariadb

Change the recorder: db_url: in your HA configuration.yaml

Example:

recorder:
  db_url: mysql://admin:password@192.168.100.26:3306/homeassistant?charset=utf8mb4

‚öôÔ∏è To Update Mariadb:

Run in the LXC console

To make sure our PostgreSQL is secured with a strong password, set a password for its system user and then change the default database admin user account

Change user password

passwd postgres

Login using Postgres system account

su - postgres

Now, change the Admin database password

psql -c "ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'your-password';"

Create a new user.

psql

CREATE USER admin WITH PASSWORD 'your-password';

Create a new database:

CREATE DATABASE homeassistant;

Grant all rights or privileges on created database to the user

GRANT ALL ON DATABASE homeassistant TO admin;

To exit psql

\q

Then type exit to get back to root

Change the recorder: db_url: in your HA configuration.yaml

Example:

recorder:
  db_url: postgresql://admin:your-password@192.168.100.20:5432/homeassistant?client_encoding=utf8
